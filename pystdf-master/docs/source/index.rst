PySTDF - The Pythonic STDF parser
=================================

**Developed by** Casey Marshall <casey.marshall@gmail.com>

**Code repository** https://github.com/cmars/pystdf

PySTDF is a parser for Standard Test Data Format (STDF) version 4 data files.
I wrote PySTDF to get familiar with functional programming idioms and
metaclasses in Python.  As such, it uses some of the more powerful and
expressive features of the Python language.

PySTDF is an event-based parser.  As an STDF file is parsed, you recieve
record *events* in callback functions

Thanks for your interest in PySTDF.  You're the reason I open-sourced it.

Cheers,
Casey
