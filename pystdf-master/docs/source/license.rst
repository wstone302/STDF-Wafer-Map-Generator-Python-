PySTDF is released under the terms and conditions of the GPL version 2 license.
You may freely use PySTDF, but you may not distribute it in closed-source
proprietary applications.  Please contact me if you are interested in
purchasing an alternative license agreement to develop commercial software
with PySTDF.

If you need some STDF consulting/development work, I might be able to help you.
I have over 5 years experience with STDF and semiconductor data analysis
systems.

If you're in the Austin area and just want to get lunch, that is cool too :)
