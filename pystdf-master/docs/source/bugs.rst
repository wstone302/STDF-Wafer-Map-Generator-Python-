PySTDF has no known bugs.  However, it is my experience that every ATE vendor
has its quirks and "special interpretation" of the STDFv4 specification.

If you find a bug in PySTDF, please send me (Casey Marshall
<casey.marshall@gmail.com>) the STDF file that demonstrates it.
This will help me improve the library.

You can also `open an issue <https://github.com/cmars/pystdf/issues>`__
on github.
