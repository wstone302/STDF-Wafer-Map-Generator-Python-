The STDF files in this directory were originally provided on Galaxy 
Semiconductor's website for demonstration of their tools.  They were 
obtained from this public URL, which I found via Google search:

http://www.galaxysemi.com/examinator/support/install.htm

I also welcome any user contributions of example STDF data, especially
different ATE platforms and STDF versions.
